# RSA CRYPTO ASSIGNMENT
Implemented a working implementation of RSA that takes a plaintext, generates a random key, converts it into the cipphetext, and prints the ciphertext along with the public keys. It also decrypts the ciphertext, and the output of decryption is matched with the original plaintext to ensure correctness of the implementation.
To use the code, just do
python3 rsa_crpyto.py

The plaintext is read from the encrpyt.txt file.
